type binder =
  | All
  (** Universal quantification.
      Each term in the list of quantified terms should represent
      a variable (optionnally typed using the {!Colon} constructor. *)
  | Ex
  (** Existencial quantification
      Each term in the list of quantified terms should represent
      a variable (optionnally typed using the {!Colon} constructor. *)
  | Pi
  (** Polymorphic type quantification in function type
      Each term in the list of quantified terms should represent
      a variable (optionnally typed using the {!Colon} constructor. *)
  | Arrow
  (** The arrow binder, for function types. Allows for curified types, if wanted. *)
  | Let
  (** Let bindings (either propositional or for terms).
      Term bound by a let can have many forms depending on the language, but usual
      shapes are:
      - an equality (using the builtin {!Eq}) between a variable
        (optionnally typed using the {!Colon} constructor),
        and a term (e.g. in tptp)
      - an equivalence (using the builtin {!Equiv}) between a variable
        (optionnally typed using the {!Colon} constructor),
        and a term/proposition (e.g. in tptp)
      - a variable and a term juxtaposed using the {!Colon} constructor (e.g. in smtlib)
  *)
  | Fun
  (** Lambda, i.e function abstraction binder.
      Bound terms are the variables bound by the lambda, optionnally typed
      using the {!Colon} constructor. *)
  | Choice
  (** Indefinite description, or epsilon terms.
      Likely to have its usual shape change following tptp's recent changes. *)
  | Description
  (** Definite description.
      Likely to have its usual shape change following tptp's recent changes. *)
(** The type of binders, these are pretty much always builtin in all languages. *)

type descr =
  | Symbol of Id.t
  (** Constants, variables, etc... any string-identified non-builtin atomic term. *)
  | Builtin of builtin
  (** Predefined builtins, i.e constants with lexical or syntaxic defintion
      in the source language. *)
  | Colon of t * t
  (** Juxtaposition of terms, usually used to annotate a term with its type
      (for quantified variables, functions arguments, etc...). *)
  | App of t * t list
  (** Higher-order application *)
  | Binder of binder * t list * t
  (** Binder (quantifiers, local functions, ...), see the {!binder} type for more
      information. *)
  | Match of t * (t * t) list
  (** Pattern matching, the list contains tuples of the form [(pattern,branch)]. *)
(** The AST for terms *)

and t = {
  term : descr;
  attr : t list;
  loc : location;
}
(** The type of terms. A record containing an optional location,
    and a description of the term. *)


(** {2 Standard functions} *)

val equal : t -> t -> bool
val compare : t -> t -> int
(** Equality and comparison *)

val pp : Buffer.t -> t -> unit
val print : Format.formatter -> t -> unit
val print_builtin : Format.formatter -> builtin -> unit
(** Printing functionson buffer and formatters. *)


(** {2 Implemented interfaces} *)

include Dolmen_intf.Term.Logic
  with type t := t
   and type id := Id.t
   and type location := location
(** Include the Logic interface. This interface defines almost all term building
    functions that you may want to use. *)


(** {2 Term constructor not in implemented interfaces} *)

val ite_t : ?loc:location -> unit -> t
(** The standalone term corresponding to the if-then-else builtin
    construction. *)


(** {2 Term inspection} *)

val fv : t -> Id.t list
(** Return the list of free variables (i.e currently, Ids that are in
    the [Var] namespace). *)


(** {2 Additional functions} *)

val builtin : builtin -> ?loc:location -> unit -> t
(** Make a builtin. *)

val fun_ty : ?loc:location -> t list -> t -> t
(** Multi-arguments function type constructor. *)

val add_attr : t -> t -> t
(** [add_attr attr term] rturns a term [t] equal to [term], but with
    [attr] added to the list of attributes. *)

val add_attrs : t list -> t -> t
(** Same as [add_attr] but adds a list of attributes. *)

val set_attrs : t list -> t -> t
(** Set the given list of terms as th attributes of the given term.
    Will fail (with an assertion) if the given term already have some assertion.
    In such cases, use add_attr instead. *)


(** {2 Term mapping}

    The main use of terms mapper is to map fuctions over some terms.
    Traditionally, a mapping will usually only care about a few syntax cases
    and leav all other untouched. In these cases, it is useful to override
    the identity mapper, redefining only the fields needed.
