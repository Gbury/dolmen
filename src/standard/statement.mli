(** Standard imlplementation of statements.
    This module provides a reasonable and standard implementation of statements,
    that can directly be used to instantiated the various functors of the dolmen library.
    These statements are closer to smtlib statements than to other languages statements
    because it is easier to express other languages statements using smtlib's than the
    other way around. Still, a generalisation of smtlib statements was needed so as not
    to lose some important distinctions between conjectures and assertions for instance.

(** {2 Type definitions} *)

type term = Term.t
type location = Loc.t
(** Type aliases for readability. *)

type abstract = {
  id : Id.t;
  ty : term;
  loc : location;
}
(** The type for abstract type definitions. *)

type inductive = {
  id : Id.t;
  vars : term list;
  cstrs : (Id.t * term list) list;
  loc : location;
  attrs : term list;
}
(** The type for inductive type declarations. The "vars" field if used
    to store polymorphic variables of the inductive type. For instance,
    a polymorphic type for lists would have a single variable "a".
    The constructors each have a name and a list of concrete arguments types
    (they all implicitly take as many type arguments as there are variables).
    So, for instance, the polymorphic list type would have two constructors:
    - ["Nil", \[\]]
    - ["Cons", \[var "a"\]]
