  ; The tptp parser generated by merlin is **big**, and in particular, contains
  ; a set of mutually recursive functions that takes about ~30k loc. Flambda
  ; exhibits a quadratic behaviour when trying to compute the invariants
  ; parameters of such a definition, which makes it take about ~15minutes to
  ; compile parser.ml
  ; Therefore, we compile this library with -Oclassic to keep a reasonable
  ; compilation time
