(** AST requirement for the Smtlib format.
    The smtlib format is widely used among SMT solvers, and is the language
    of the smtlib benchmark library. Terms are expressed as s-expressions,
    and top-level directives include everything needed to use a prover
    in an interactive loop (so it includes directive for getting and setting options,
    getting information about the solver's internal model, etc...) *)
