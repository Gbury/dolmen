  (** Expand statements (such as includes). Returns the new state, and either:
      - [ `Ok ], which means the statement can be propagated as is
      - [ `Gen (flat, g) ], if the statement expands into a generator [g]. The bool [flat]
        indicates wether the statements in [g] should be treated as a single group of
        statements (with regards to timeouts, etc...), or as a list of independant statements
        (each with its own timeout...). *)
