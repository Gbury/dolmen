# Printing

- Add comments
- generate headers when printing to smtlib ?


# Normalisation / transformation

- add implicit base type decl (tptp's $i)
- expand some unavailable builtins (i.e. pow/exponentiation is not available in smtlib)
- scan terms and create and insert a set-logic
- renaming of unused variables ? (insert a `_` at the start of the name)
- simplify corner case of some translations (e.g. ae's `goal` is translated as push/assert-not/check-sat/pop,
  but when there is only one in a problem, the pushs/pops are not needed)


# Misc

- maintain stack of locations for included files for error messages
