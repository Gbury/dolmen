Error while parsing arguments of a constructor in a pattern,
      read the reserved word 'lambda',
      but expected a symbol or '_' to bind the first constructor argument;
      note that keywords and reserved words (such as 'lambda', 'as', ...) are
      not symbols, and thus are not allowed here.
