Error while parsing a match case, read the reserved word 'as',
      but expected a pattern, i.e. either a symbol, '_',  or a datatype
      pattern of the form "(symbol symbol_+)" (with '_' also allowed); note
      that keywords and reserved words (such as 'lambda', 'as', ...) are not
      symbols, and thus are not allowed here.
