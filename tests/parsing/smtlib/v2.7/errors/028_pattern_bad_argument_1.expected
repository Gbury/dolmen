Error while parsing arguments of a constructor in a pattern,
      read the reserved word 'lambda',
      but expected a closing parenthesis, or a symbol (or '_') to bind the
      argument; note that keywords and reserved words (such as 'lambda',
      'as', ...) are not symbols, and thus are not allowed here.
